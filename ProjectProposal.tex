\section{Objectives}
The purpose of this project is to improve the use and efficiency of the IMPipeline for the WFIRST CGI. The following is an itemized lists of the objectives for this summer: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Construct a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for the IMPipeline
\item Create a batch scheduler 
\item Perform runs of the developed software including the GUI and batch scheduler
\end{itemize}
At this point in the modeling process, the tool developer is the only one who is capable of performing these tasks. For this reason, the goal of this GUI is to grant anyone the ability to set up and execute stop modeling runs. Constructing a GUI will be done using QTDesigner in Python.
